Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of control-plane nodes by copying certificate authorities
and service account keys on each node and then running the following as root:

  kubeadm join betelgeuse.orion.gasy.africa:6443 --token 4gp39y.898okq2rcj3j8wgl \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:348cf90011e40088944a5f5cfe3279c04a0dfb24f56ba21209e61fdc15af3645 \
    --control-plane

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join betelgeuse.orion.gasy.africa:6443 --token 4gp39y.898okq2rcj3j8wgl \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:348cf90011e40088944a5f5cfe3279c04a0dfb24f56ba21209e61fdc15af3645
```
